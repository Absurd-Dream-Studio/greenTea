# greenTea
A Comprehensive Framework for Web Applications and Games in TypeScript, it has following features

## Entity component system

Entity Component System (ECS) is a powerful and flexible architecture for managing entities, components, and systems in a game or application. It separates concerns and promotes code reuse by treating entities as containers for components and systems as functions that operate on those components.

## 2d physics system

A 2D physics system handles collision detection, response, and motion simulation within a 2D game environment, ensuring realistic behavior of game objects and interactivity between them.

## Gesture system

The gesture system allows users to control or manipulate elements within the application through various gestures (e.g., click, long press, release).

## UI system

The UI System enables the creation of intuitive, adaptive, and reusable user interfaces through the utilization of React, an extensively used JavaScript library designed specifically for UI development.

## 2d graphics render system

The 2D graphics render system takes care of drawing and updating visual elements on the screen in a 2D game or application, utilizing various techniques like sprite rendering and texturing to create the desired visuals.

## Animation system

The animation system manages and controls the movement, transformation, and other dynamic properties of game objects over time, allowing for smooth and visually appealing effects.

## Scene system

Scene system organizes game levels or scenes by managing the placement and behavior of various elements within them. This allows for efficient management of complex game worlds and seamless transitions between different environments.

## AI system

build in behavior tree library to develop AI functionality within the application.
